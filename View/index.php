The bus ticketing system is an essential component of public transportation that enables passengers to book and purchase bus tickets in advance. 
It is a web-based application that facilitates easy and convenient ticket booking and payment options for commuters. 
The system provides real-time information about bus routes, schedules, and ticket availability to ensure a seamless and hassle-free travel experience for passengers.

The bus ticketing system is designed to simplify the bus booking process by allowing passengers to book their tickets online from the comfort of their homes or offices. 
This eliminates the need for physical ticket counters and long queues, making the process more efficient and convenient for both passengers and bus operators.
